## Setup

To get started with aoi.js, follow these steps:

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";
import { LinkCard } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    **NodeJS v20 or higher is required.**

    ```bash
    npm install aoi.js
    ```

  </TabItem >
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    **NodeJS v20 or higher is required.**

    ```bash
    pnpm add aoi.js
    ```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="yarn">
    **NodeJS v20 or higher is required.**

    ```bash
    yarn add aoi.js
    ```

  </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="bun">
    **NodeJS v20 or higher is required.**

    bun install aoi.js
    ```

  </TabItem>

To get started with aoi.js, note the following
- You will need an application created from the [Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
- Make sure all the intents are checked, as some functions require them. If you can't do so then ignore this step.
- You will need the bot token to run your bot.

### Getting Started

Before we get started, create a new file called `index.js` and follow these steps carefully.

Firstly, we import the `AoiClient` class from aoi.js.

```diff lang="js" title="index.js"
+ const { AoiClient } = require("aoi.js");
```

Next we add the main part, which will define our bot.

```diff lang="js" title="index.js"
const { AoiClient } = require("aoi.js");

+ const client = new AoiClient({
+  token: "Discord Bot Token",
+  prefix: "Discord Bot Prefix",
+  intents: ["MessageContent", "Guilds", "GuildMessages"],
+  events: ["onMessage", "onInteractionCreate"],
+  database: {
+    type: "aoi.db",
+    db: require("@akarui/aoi.db"),
+    dbType: "KeyValue",
+    tables: ["main"],
+    securityKey: "a-32-characters-long-string-here",
+  }
+ });
```

The token part is where your Discord Token goes, which you previously copied from the Developer Portal.
```diff lang="js" title="index.js"
+ token: "Your Discord Bot Token"
```

The prefix part is where your bot's prefix goes, you can even have multiple prefixes.
```js {1} {4} title="index.js"
prefix: "Your Discord Bot Prefix"

// You can also have multiple prefixes
prefix: ["Your Prefix", "Another Prefix"]
```

In the end your index.js file should look like the following:

```javascript {1-15} title="index.js"
const { AoiClient } = require("aoi.js");

const client = new AoiClient({
  token: "Discord Bot Token",
  prefix: "Discord Bot Prefix",
  intents: ["MessageContent", "Guilds", "GuildMessages"],
  events: ["onMessage", "onInteractionCreate"],
  database: {
    type: "aoi.db",
    db: require("@akarui/aoi.db"),
    dbType: "KeyValue",
    tables: ["main"],
    securityKey: "a-32-characters-long-string-here",
  }
});
```

Now we can run our bot, but there isn't any functionality yet.
