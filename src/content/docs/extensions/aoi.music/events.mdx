#### Adding Events

```js
voice.addEvent(PlayerEvents.eventName);
```

#### List of Events

- `TrackStart` &rarr; Emitted whenever a track starts.
- `TrackEnd` &rarr; Emitted whenever a track ends.
- `QueueStart` &rarr; Emitted whenever a queue starts.
- `QueueEnd` &rarr; Emitted whenever a queue ends.
- `AudioError` &rarr; Emitted whenever a audio error occurs.
- `TrackPause` &rarr; Emitted whenever a track pauses.
- `TrackResume` &rarr; Emitted whenever a track resumes.

### Using Events

:::warn[Command]

You can only have aoi.music events in that given directory, adding aoi.js commands WILL return errors.

:::

```js
const { LoadCommands } = require("aoi.js");

...

const loader = new LoadCommands(client);
loader.load(voice.cmds, "./voice/");
```

This should be the content of your `./voice/<filename>.js`:

```js
module.exports = [
  {
    channel: "$channelID",
    type: "eventName",
    code: `code to execute here`,
  },
];
```

If you don't want to use handlers, you can use this instead in your main file also known as `index.js`:

```js
voice.cmds["eventName"].set("name of the command", {
  channel: "$channelID",
  code: `code to execute here`,
});
```
